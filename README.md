# approximate-truncated-fourier-series
Reduce the number of integrals used in truncated Fouries series of any two-dimensional function


Need Chebfun (https://www.chebfun.org/) to generate the points and weights for the Clenshaw-Curtis (CC) quadrature, the Gauss-Legendre (GL) quadrature and the Newton-Cotes (NC) quadrature.

Three test functions are used. More other two-dimensional functions can be similarly used in our algorithms.
